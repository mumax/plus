Domain wall motion with surface acoustic waves
==============================================

In this example we move a domain wall by setting a time and space dependent
strain in a ferromagnet to simulate the effect of a SAW wave. This is
based on the method used `here <https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.108.104420>`_.
