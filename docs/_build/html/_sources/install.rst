Installation
============

Dependencies
------------

mumax⁺ should work on any NVIDIA GPU. To get sarted you should install the
following tools yourself. Open the dropdowns for more details.

.. dropdown:: CUDA Toolkit

   To see which CUDA Toolkit works for your GPU's Compute Capability, check
   `this Stack Overflow post <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28932864/which-compute-capability-is-supported-by-which-cuda-versions>`_.
  
   -  **Windows**: Download an installer from `the CUDA website <https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit-archive>`_.
   -  **Linux**: Use ``sudo apt-get install nvidia-cuda-toolkit``, or `download an installer <https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit-archive>`_.

   .. important::

      Make especially sure that everything CUDA-related (like ``nvcc``) can
      be found inside your PATH. On Linux, for instance, this can be done
      by editing your ``~/.bashrc`` file and adding the following lines:

      .. code-block:: bash

         # add CUDA
         export PATH="/usr/local/cuda/bin:$PATH"
         export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/usr/local/cuda/> lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"

      The paths may differ if the CUDA Toolkit was installed in a different
      location.

   👉 *Check CUDA installation with:* ``nvcc --version``

.. dropdown:: A C++ compiler which supports C++17

   - **Linux:** ``sudo apt-get install gcc``
      - ⚠️ each CUDA version has a maximum supported ``gcc`` version. `This StackOverflow answer <https://stackoverflow.com/a/46380601>`_ lists the maximum supported ``gcc`` version for each CUDA version. If necessary, use ``sudo apt-get install gcc-<min_version>`` instead, with the appropriate ``<min_version>``.
   - **Windows:**
      - CUDA does not support the ``gcc`` compiler on Windows, so download and install `Microsoft Visual Studio <https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/>`_ with the "Desktop development with C++" workload. After installing, check if the path to ``cl.exe`` was added to your ``PATH`` environment variable (i.e., check whether ``where cl.exe`` returns an appropriate path like ``C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Community\VC\Tools\MSVC\14.29.30133\bin\HostX64\x64``). If not, add it manually.

   👉 *Check C installation with:* ``gcc --version`` *on Linux and* ``where.exe cl.exe`` *on Windows.*

.. dropdown:: Git

   - **Windows:** `Download <https://git-scm.com/downloads>`_ and install.
   - **Linux:** ``sudo apt install git``

   👉 *Check Git installation with:* ``git --version``

.. dropdown:: CPython *(version ≥ 3.8 recommended)*, pip and miniconda/anaconda

   All these Python-related tools should be included in a standard installation of `Anaconda or Miniconda <https://www.anaconda.com/download/success>`_.

   👉 *Check installation with* ``python --version``, ``pip --version`` *and* ``conda --version``.

Building mumax⁺
---------------

First, clone the mumax⁺ Git repository. The ``--recursive`` flag is used in the following command to get the pybind11 submodule, which is needed to build mumax⁺.

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone --recursive https://github.com/mumax/plus.git mumaxplus
   cd mumaxplus

We recommend to install mumax⁺ in a clean conda environment as follows. You could also skip this step and use your own conda environment instead if preferred.

.. dropdown:: Tools automatically installed in the conda environment

   - cmake 4.0.0
   - Python 3.13
   - pybind11 v2.13.6
   - NumPy
   - matplotlib
   - SciPy
   - Sphinx

.. code-block:: bash

   conda env create -f environment.yml
   conda activate mumaxplus

Finally, build and install mumax⁺ using pip.

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install .

.. tip::

   If changes are made to the code, then ``pip install -v .`` can be used to rebuild mumax⁺, with the ``-v`` flag enabling verbose debug information.
   
   If you want to change only the Python code, without needing to reinstall after each change, ``pip install -ve .`` can also be used.

.. tip::

   The source code can also be compiled with double precision, by changing ``FP_PRECISION`` in ``CMakeLists.txt`` from ``SINGLE`` to ``DOUBLE`` before rebuilding.

   .. code-block:: cmake

      add_definitions(-DFP_PRECISION=DOUBLE) # FP_PRECISION > should be SINGLE or DOUBLE

Check the compilation
---------------------

To check if you successfully compiled mumax⁺, we recommend you to run some examples from the ``examples/`` directory, such as standard problem 4.

.. code-block:: bash

   python examples/standardproblem4.py

Or you could run the tests from the ``test/`` directory.

.. code-block:: bash

   pytest test

.. dropdown:: Troubleshooting

   - (*Windows*) If you encounter the error ``No CUDA toolset found``, try copying the files in ``NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit/CUDA/<version>/extras/visual_studio_integration/MSBuildExtensions`` to ``Microsoft Visual Studio/<year>/<edition>/MSBuild/Microsoft/VC/<version>/BuildCustomizations``. See `these instructions <https://github.com/NVlabs/tiny-cuda-nn/issues/164#issuecomment-1280749170>`_ for more details.
