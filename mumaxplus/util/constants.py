"""Physical constants used in mumax‚Å∫.
This file copies src/physics/constants.hpp.

The values of these constants might differ from what you find elsewhere. These
values are from before the SI unit redefinition of 2019/05/20, in order to stay
consistent with decades of other code and standard problems.
