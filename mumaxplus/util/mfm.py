        This class is used to create a magnetic force microscopy image. The
        needle is simulated as a pair of monopoles with a charge of 1/µ0 at a
        distance `tipsize` from one another. Here µ0 is the vacuum permeability.
        The height of the needle is determined by the origin of the input `grid`
        and the `lift` of the needle.

        When the `eval` function is called for this instance, it returns a numpy
        array of the same size as the input `grid` which contains the potential
        energy due to the interaction of the magnet(s) and the needle.
        
        Parameters
        ----------
        input : can be either a World or Magnet instance. If it is a
                World, all magnets in that world will be used to calculate
                the potential energy of the magnet.
        grid : this is a Grid instance used as a scanning surface.
               Physically, this is the plane on which the MFM needle moves."""
