    ----------
    cellsize : tuple[float] of size 3
        A tuple of three floating pointing numbers which represent the dimensions
        of the cells in the x, y, and z direction.

    pbc_repetitions : tuple[int] of size 3, default=(0,0,0)
        The number of repetitions for everything inside mastergrid in the
        x, y and z directions to create periodic boundary conditions.
        The number of repetitions determines the cutoff range for the
        demagnetization.
    
    mastergrid : Grid, default=Grid((0,0,0))
        Mastergrid defines a periodic simulation box. If it has zero size in
        a direction, then it is considered to be infinitely large
        (no periodicity) in that direction.
        A 0 in `mastergrid` should correspond to a 0 in `pbc_repetitions`.
        All subsequently added magnets need to fit inside this mastergrid.
